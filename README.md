## Description   
project 1 ROCK VS Mine Prediction is building a system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, we are using the Logistic Regression Model for our prediction  

## How to run   
First, install dependencies   
```bash
# install  project   
https://github.com/Abrammse/project-1-ROCK-VS-Mine-Prediction-ML-.git
 ```   
 Next, navigate to any file and run it.   
 ```bash
# module folder
cd ROCK-VS-Mine-Prediction-ML

# run module on co-lap or Anaconda
 if use colap don't  forget  upload  his dataset on co lap   and change the link dataset


```
